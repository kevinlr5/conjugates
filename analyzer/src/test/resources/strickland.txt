With two outs in the eighth inning and nobody on, Strickland threw his first pitch into Harper’s hip. Nobody could dispute Strickland’s intent.
Harper immediately pointed his bat at Strickland, dropped it and charged the mound in a confrontation that Strickland appeared to want. Harper looked as though he was going to throw his helmet at Strickland but tossed it wide and went at his foe with his fists.
This was no air-slapping baseball nonfight. Strickland landed a solid right into Harper’s face and Harper later returned the favor.
As the teams converged near the mound, former Washington first baseman Michael Morse and Jeff Samardzija, coming from different directions, tried to get between the combatants and slammed into one another in a collision that sent both to the ground.
Strickland did not calm down for a long time. He had to be dragged off the field by George Kontos, Mac Williamson and Hunter Pence, who struggled to get the pitcher into the dugout.
Strickland and Harper were ejected. Pence, who is on the disabled list, had no business on the field under baseball rules, as a nonactive player, and could face discipline as well.
The bad blood goes back to the 2014 Division Series. After Harper homered off Strickland in Game 1 in Washington, the Giants’ right-hander defiantly said he would continue to throw fastballs to Harper.
Strickland did, and after Harper homered into McCovey Cove in Game 4, he watched the ball for a good while, hollered at Strickland during his trot and did not stop once he got to the dugout.
The Giants clinched the series with a 3-2 win. Strickland and Harper did not meet again until Monday.
Kontos relieved Strickland and allowed a Daniel Murphy RBI single that cashed in the hit batsman.
Ryan Zimmerman had done most of the damage before that with a solo homer and a single that contributed to the second and final run that Matt Moore allowed in seven innings.
