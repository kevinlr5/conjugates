# conjugates

A server that can analyze the Russell Conjugation of inputs

- Russell Conjugation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotive_conjugation
- Repo: https://github.com/kevinlr5/conjugates

## Overview

Bertrand Russell and others have made the observation that using different words to describe the same thing can affect how people feel about that thing. There are theories that people often have conflicting opinions on the same thing and that the terms used to describe that thing affect which opinion wins out. This project analyzes text and shows whether or not that text is meant to elicit positive or negative feelings about the subjects therein.

Additionally, this project is designed to use modern devops techniques including continuous deployment with zero downtime upgrading. Take a look at the technical documentation below for more information!
